* ###Problem
The problem is to create an app  that is supposed to give the user the choices. Amongst the choices the user must be able to:
* get the 10 most recent job posed
* search for all jobs within the last 48 hours
* change the date and it shows the last 48 hours from the date I choose (date format as in YYYY-MM-DD)
* can save a job and it should show on my homepage (in addition to the most recent 10 jobs)

* ###Solution
    * Method  
      Daily meetings with Deboroh to share ideas.
    * Process
        * Used PHPStorm
        * Used branching on GitHub
        * Used the CommandLine
        * Youtube, google research
        
    * Result + Demo
        * [Job and Job](https://sprint5-joband-job.vercel.app/)
